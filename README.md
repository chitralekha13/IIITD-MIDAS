# IIITD-MIDAS
**Product Category Classification**

**General Description:-**

This project deals with the cleaning up of data to eliminate the barely necessary information from the data and segregate the important categories to work on. Further the data is to studied and visualized using graphs and other visualizing factors to help you learn the statistics of the data at one go. A model is to be built using the given information to predict which category a particular picked data sets into and the accuracy has to be calculated and mentioned. The description of the product was to be used to predict the category but we were allowed to use the requires information for prediction.

**Install:-**

This project requires python and the following libraries installed.

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Nltk
- Nltk.corpus
- Sys
- Warnings

You also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

**Operating System:-**

OS: Widows XP or higher

RAM: 4 GB or higher

**Code:-**

Template code is provided in the product.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included dataset.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

**Run:-**

In a terminal or a command window, navigate to top level project directory and run one of the following commands

- ipython notebook.product.ipynb
- jupyter notebook.product.ipynb

These commands will help you to open the jupyter notebook software and project file in your browser.

**Note:-**

- Before we started we divided our dataset into training set and testing set in the ratio of 80% to 20% respectively.
- The number of iterations( epoch ) used in the model are- 80

**Result:-**

The validation accuracy of our model is-97
